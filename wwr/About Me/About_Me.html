    <h2>Brian Cheek</h2>
    <p>My name is Brian Cheek, I am from Indiana currently studying in accounting with a minor in data science, this
        class is part of that minor. I look forward to studying more about html, css, and other programming lanugages.
        I'm facinated with programming and increasing my skills to allow for new avenues I thought weren't possible
        before. Since ive started coding, I've worked to create spreadsheets for sale. I currently sell on etsy and,
        and any one can see my listing ;however, I currently just one for the purpose of helping anyone create a budget.
        Feel free to check out my listing at https://codedspreadsheets.etsy.com. I see this class becoming handy
        in creating my own website if I choose to create a better network for my listings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aside from my passion in building my career, I'm super nerdy and really enjoy the Lord of the Rings, This is pretty much a good summary
        about me and I look forward to increasing my knowledge and abilities for my career.
